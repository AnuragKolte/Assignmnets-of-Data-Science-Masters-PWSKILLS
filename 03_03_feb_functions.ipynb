    " # Q2 Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs to demonstrate their use.\n",
    "answer -> The `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters in Python functions allow for flexibility when dealing with varying numbers of arguments or keyword arguments. Here's a brief explanation of how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `*args` (Arbitrary Arguments): The `*args` parameter allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments. When `*args` is used in a function definition, it collects all the positional arguments passed to the function into a tuple. The name `args` is arbitrary and can be changed, but the asterisk (*) before the parameter is necessary to denote that it collects multiple arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `**kwargs` (Arbitrary Keyword Arguments): The `**kwargs` parameter allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments. Similar to `*args`, `**kwargs` collects the keyword arguments into a dictionary. The name `kwargs` is arbitrary and can be changed, but the double asterisks (**) before the parameter are necessary to denote that it collects multiple keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's create a function each for `*args` and `**kwargs` to illustrate their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum_args(*args):\n",
    "    total = sum(args)\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_kwargs(**kwargs):\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "print(sum_args(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "print_kwargs(name=\"John\", age=25, city=\"New York\")\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# name: John\n",
    "# age: 25\n",
    "# city: New York\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `sum_args` function, `*args` collects all the positional arguments and stores them in a tuple. The function then calculates the sum of the values in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `print_kwargs` function, `**kwargs` collects all the keyword arguments and stores them in a dictionary. The function then iterates over the dictionary and prints each key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `*args` and `**kwargs`, you can create functions that can handle a varying number of arguments or keyword arguments, providing greater flexibility and allowing callers of the function to pass in different numbers of arguments as needed."

    "# Q4.  What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator function.\n",
    "In Python, a generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator object called a generator. Unlike regular functions that use the `return` statement to return a value and terminate, generator functions use the `yield` keyword to produce a sequence of values while maintaining their internal state between successive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `yield` keyword is used in generator functions to define a point at which the function will pause its execution and yield a value to the caller. The function's state is saved, allowing it to resume from where it left off when the next value is requested. This makes generator functions a memory-efficient way to generate a large sequence of values, as they generate values on-the-fly instead of storing them all in memory.\n",

    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `even_numbers()` function is a generator function. It uses a `while` loop to generate even numbers. The `yield` keyword is used to yield the current value of `n` as the next value in the sequence. The function's state is saved, allowing it to continue from where it left off in the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling `even_numbers(10)`, it returns a generator object `even_gen`. We can then iterate over this generator object using a loop or by calling the `next()` function to retrieve the next value in the sequence.\n",
