    "Sure, let me explain the use of these operators in Python with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) `/` (Division Operator):\n",
    "   - The `/` operator is used for division in Python.\n",
    "   - It performs floating-point division, which means it returns a floating-point result, even if the operands are integers.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 10 / 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) `%` (Modulus Operator):\n",
    "   - The `%` operator calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another.\n",
    "   - It is often used to check for divisibility or to find the remainder of a division operation.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     remainder = 10 % 3\n",
    "     print(remainder)  # Output: 1 (because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) `//` (Floor Division Operator):\n",
    "   - The `//` operator is used for floor division, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division.\n",
    "   - It discards the fractional part and returns an integer result.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 10 // 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 3 (because 10 divided by 3 is 3.333, but // returns 3)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) `**` (Exponentiation Operator):\n",
    "   - The `**` operator is used for exponentiation, which means raising one number to the power of another.\n",
    "   - It can be used to calculate exponentials.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 2 ** 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 8 (because 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators are fundamental in mathematical operations and are frequently used in various calculations and expressions within Python programs."
